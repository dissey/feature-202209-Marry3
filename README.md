ERC721-520 Token is an implementation of NFT-like Soulbound Token Standard, which is an extension of ERC721 standard.

- non-transferable and non-sellable, one person can only have one valid Token at the same time.
- mint paired soulbound token through multi-signature flow, Mint will issue 2 Soulbound Tokens at one time.
- can be destroyed through multi-signature flow, and new Soulbound Token can be minted with other addresses after burn.

Marry3 is a social experiment project. His original idea originated from the low-level thinking about the 0x address in Web3 as an aboriginal, and his landing idea was based on thinking about some unhealthy status quo of the Web3 ecology. The answer is a non-tradable, non-transferable, pair-bound no-finance nft, which fits perfectly with the idea of ​​SBTs (soulbound tokens).

it's an on-chain Dapp developed based on the ERC721-520 standard contract. Its core implements:

- Marry3 Certificate, based on the ERC721-520 standard, it has some special features, it is non-transferable, non-sellable, and an address can only have one Token at the same time.
- The Marry3 contract and Dapp implement the logic of payment and multi-signature verification (analogous to negotiated marriage proposal, negotiated divorce, etc. in the real world).

Web3 is a new world rebuilt from scratch, it has a new order and rules (Code is Law), a new way of organization (DAO), a new identity (NFT&ENS), and a new indigenous people (0x address) .

The new world brings unlimited imagination and freedom, but it also brings some new problems, such as more fragile economic bubbles and tedious finance dapps.

Therefore, we want to give full play to its advantages, avoid its problems, and allow this ecology to develop in a healthier direction

So, there is marry3

This is a serious social experiment, and we want to explore a new identity with all the inhabitants of the new world.

At the same time, it is also a vertical scenario implementation of SBTs (Soulbound Tokens). The relationship and identity data generated by it and other SBTs applications will become a very vivid expression of the aborigines of the 0x address, making them have personality, reputation, and preferences. The cost of forging such an identity personality will also be higher and higher, especially under the premise of no profit-driven (no-finance)

At the same time, because it takes place in the new world, it will break the limitations of physical space, regardless of gender, age, race, or even species (there may be any species behind the aborigines of the 0x address, such as cats or A dog).

Because it takes place in the new world, it will make full use of the rules of the new world to witness an intimate relationship, and it will write the relationship and agreement between two addresses into an ERC721-520 contract. The contract code is both God and law. Since then, One person, one witness, one heart and one mind.
